Build a modern, eco-friendly e-commerce platform called EcoCart. The website should feel clean, professional, and eco-conscious, using forest green, light green, and yellow as brand colors. Use soft, minimal design with rounded corners, smooth shadows, and subtle animations. The site should be fully responsive, accessible, and hackathon-ready.
